    <h1>Bansuri</h1>
    <main>
        <p>Bansuri is a very sensitive instrument; almost all the delicate graces, curves, embellishments and shades of classical music can be performed to perfection upon it. The highest order of music can be played on this instrument, and its resonance in mandra saptak (lower octave) leaves a rare charm in the minds of its listeners. Being a portable instrument, it can be carried easily from place to place and climatic changes have very little or no effect on the seasoned bamboo.</p>
        <p>The flute is a simple bamboo tube of uniform bore. The tube must be closed at one end. The closure may be natural, that is by the node of the stem, or, if there is no natural closure, one end may be plugged with a cork or stopper. The bamboo chosen to make the flute must be selected very carefully. It should be neither too old nor too young a plant, of medium thickness, and the stem should be clean and smooth, free from cracks, bumps, holes or other damages. Once selected the bamboo tube is best dried in the shade for approximately one year. It is then ready to be converted into a flute, to have holes of an appropriate-size and number pierced into it. The best bamboo comes from the northeast region, preferably from Assam or Tripura. The length of the flute is normally between two-and-a- half feet to less than three feet, depending upon the thickness of the wall and density of the bamboo.</p>

                    The bansuri is a hollow bamboo tube which is closed at the upper end. It has six to seven finger holes and one blowing hole. Usually it has several tight thread bindings to prevent it from cracking. Bansuris in professional quality often have a varnished outer surface. The bamboo suitable for making a bansuri must be thin walled and straight with a uniform circular cross section and long internodes. Being a natural material, it is difficult to find bamboo shafts with all these characteristics, which in turn makes good bansuris rare and expensive. Suitable species of bamboo (such as Pseudostachyum) with these traits are endemic to the forests of Assam and Kerala.

                    The bansuri is blown sideways like the Western flute. Fully closing or opening the finger holes produces a diatonic scale. Half opening of the finger holes produces the half notes and micro intervals in between, thus enabling bansuri performers to play any note combination derived from the chromatic Western scale or from the Indian raga tradition. Instead of using the fingertips the finger joints are used to cover the holes. That way it is possible to grab even the long deep bansuris commonly used for classical solo performance. Smooth sliding of the fingers produces the glissando movements and microintervals so essential to Indian music. The tonic note Sa is produced by fully closing the first three finger holes. The lowest note is reached by closing all six fingerholes and is a fourth below the tonic Sa. India Instruments usually mentions both the tonic Sa and the lowest note in order to avoid any misunderstandings.
